This script searches for each of your liked Pandora songs and downloads the first YouTube result for "Title Artist" (some music is not avaiblable).

Your Pandora listening activity must be public for this script to work. You can edit your privacy settings here:

A good way to keep up to date with your Pandora favorites is to add this script into cron and have it run daily. You can edit your crontab with the command "crontab -e". When using this script via cron, a display must be specified to send the notifications to. Here is an example:

$ crontab -e
@hourly env DISPLAY=:0 python ~/path/to/likes_pandora.py

Requires youtube-dl to be installed. follow instruction here: 
http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/
Or use your favorite package-management system to install youtube-dl. Make sure youtube-dl is up to date if there are problems by running 'youtube-dl -U'.

Notifications require Nofify OSD (https://launchpad.net/notify-osd), which ships with Ubuntu.

See http://www.github.com/nospampleasemam/youtube_backup for more information and the latest version.
