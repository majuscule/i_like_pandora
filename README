This script searches for each of your liked pandora songs and downloads the first YouTube result for "Title Artist" (some music is not avaiblable).

This script allows you to quickly come back to all the songs you've forgotten you loved. A good way to keep up to date with your Pandora favorites is to add this script into cron and have it run daily. Remember to edit the settings in the first part of the script.

You can edit your crontab with the command "crontab -e". When using this script via cron, a display must be specified to send the notifications to. Here is an example:

$ crontab -e
@hourly env DISPLAY=:0 python ~/path/to/likes_pandora.py

Requires youtube-dl to be installed. follow instruction here: 
http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/
Or use your favorite package-management system to install youtube-dl. Make sure youtube-dl is up to date if there are problems by running 'youtube-dl -U'.

Notifications require Nofify OSD (https://launchpad.net/notify-osd), which ships with Ubuntu.

See http://www.github.com/nospampleasemam/youtube_backup for more information and the latest version.
